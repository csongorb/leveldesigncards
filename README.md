Thanks to all the **universities / schools / institutions** where I had the opportunity to teach courses, supervise students and projects, and refine the idea of the brainstorming cards. And of course a huge thank you to all the **students** who have contributed with all their comments and critiques... and who have tolerated my experiments.
